# Angular Challenge
 - **You must create the calendar component yourself**. Do not user calendar libraries like FullCalendar or Bootstrap Calendar.
 - Provide working API keys to any external API you use.
 - Show us your capabilities on CSS and styling, if possible.
 - You will need to **record a video explaining the code** you created, the decisions you made, its functionality, and demonstrating the complete operation of the challenge. _Remember to show the execution from scratch, it should not be running beforehand._
